# Security Policy

We appreciate your time and effort in responsibly reporting any security vulnerabilities you may find on our blockchain or in the related tooling.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please write an email to <security@concordium.com>.**

Do not create a public bug ticket mentioning the vulnerability or discuss it publically before we got the chance to fix it.

Your mail report should include the following information:
- **description of the vulnerability**
- **clear steps to reproduce**
- potential impact
- attack scenario (if any)
- affected components
- github username

We encourage you to use our [public key](#public-key) when sending sensitive information.

You'll receive a response to your email after we had time to carefully assess you report. If applicable, a new [security advisory](https://github.com/concordium-cl/sandbox/security/advisories) will be opened and all further communication will proceed there with you as invited collaborator.

Before writing to us, please check [scope](#scope), [out of scope](#out-of-scope), and previously published [security advisories](https://github.com/concordium-cl/sandbox/security/advisories).
